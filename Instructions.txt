Instructions for using our recommendation system:

1) Set your current directory to ../bee.rs/recommending

2) To use the content-based beer recommender, run "python knn.py".

   To use the collaborative beer recommender, run "python knn2.py".

3) You will be presented with a command-line prompt asking you to give the name of
   a beer that you like. If the name you supply is not in our database, our program
   will present you with a series of similar beer names from our database, each followed
   by a yes/no prompt. If you accept one of the suggestions (or your input beer is in
   our database), you will be asked how many recommendations you want to see. Once you
   give a number (integer values only), the program should give you a list of beers.
